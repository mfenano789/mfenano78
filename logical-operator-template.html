        <p>In JavaScript, there are four fundamental logical operators that allow developers to manipulate and control the
            flow of their programs: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT), and ?? (nullish coalescing). The
            logical AND (&&) operator evaluates to true if both of its operands are true. The logical OR (||) operator
            evaluates to true if at least one of its operands is true. The logical NOT (!) operator negates the truthiness of
            an expression, turning true into false and vice versa. The nullish coalescing (??) operator is used to provide a
            default value when dealing with potentially null or undefined variables.</p>

           let input1 = prompt("Enter your first input:");
let input2 = prompt("Enter your second input:");

let andResult = input1 && input2;
let orResult = input1 || input2;
let notResult = !input1;
let nullishResult = input1 ?? input2;

alert(`Results:
- AND: ${andResult}
- OR: ${orResult}
- NOT: ${notResult}
- NULLISH COALESCING: ${nullishResult}`);
