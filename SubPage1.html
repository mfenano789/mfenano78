                        Mansa Musa reigned from 1312 to 1337 was the ninth  Mansa of the Mali Empire, 
                        which reached its territorial peak during his reign. Musa is known for his wealth and generosity. 
                        He has been subject to popular claims that he is the wealthiest person in history,
                        but the extent of his actual wealth is not known with any certaint      
                        It is known from local manuscripts and travellers accounts that Mansa Musa's wealth came principally.
                        From the Mali Empire controlling and taxing the trade in salt from northern regions and especially from gold panned and mined,
                        in the gold rich regions to the south: Bambuk, Wangara, Bure, Galam, Taghaza and other such kingdoms over many centuries. 
                        Over a very long period Mali had created a large reserve of gold. Mali is also suspected to have been involved in the trade.
                        in many goods such as ivory, slaves, spices, silks, and ceramics. 
                        However presently little is known about the extent or mechanics of these trades. 
                        At the time of Musa's ascension to the throne, 
                        Mali in large part consisted of the territory of the former Ghana Empire, which Mali had conquered. 
                        The Mali Empire consisted of land that is now part of Guinea, Senegal, Mauritania, the Gambia, 
                        and the modern state of Mali.
                        Musa went on Hajj to Mecca in 1324, 
                        traveling with an enormous entourage and a vast supply of gold. 
                        On his way: 
                        He spent time in Cairo, where his lavish gift-giving is said to have noticeably affected the value of gold,
                        in Egypt and garnered the attention of the wider Muslim world. 
                        Musa expanded the borders of the Mali Empire, in particular incorporating the cities of Gao and Timbuktu into its territory. 
                        He sought closer ties with the rest of the Muslim world, particularly the Mamluk and Marinid Sultanates. He recruited scholars from the wider,
                        Muslim world to travel to Mali, such as the Andalusian poet Abu Ishaq al-Sahili, 
                        and helped establish Timbuktu as a center of Islamic learning. His reign is associated with numerous construction projects, 
                        including part of Djinguereber Mosque in Timbuktu. 
                        Musa's reign is often regarded as the zenith of Mali's power and prestige.
