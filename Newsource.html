                <p>In 2001 Conté organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term and in 2003 begun his third term after elections were boycotted,
                  by the opposition. In January 2005, Conté survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a rare public appearance in the capital Conakry. 
                  His opponents claimed that he was a "tired dictator" whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents. 
                  Guinea still faces very real problems and according to Foreign Policy is in danger of becoming a failed state.
                  In 2000 Guinea became embroiled in the instability which had long blighted the rest of West Africa as rebels crossed the borders,
                  with Liberia and Sierra Leone and it seemed for a time that the country was headed for civil war. Conté blamed neighbouring.
                  leaders for coveting Guinea's natural resources, though these claims were strenuously denied.[11] In 2003 Guinea agreed plans with her neighbours to tackle the insurgents. 
                  In 2007 there were big protests against the government, resulting in the appointment of a new prime minister. </p>

              <p>The National Assembly of Guinea, the country's legislative body, has not met since 2008 when it was dissolved after the military coup in December.
                   Elections have been postponed many times since 2007 and, most recently, were scheduled for 8 July 2012. In April 2012, 
                   President Condé postponed the elections indefinitely, citing the need to ensure that they were "transparent and democratic".
                   In February 2013, a plane carrying the head of the Guinean armed forces, General Kelefa Diallo, and nine other military officials, 
                   crashed on its way to the Liberian capital, Monrovia </p>
