                    <p> Growing up as a typical boy, I hated football. I couldn't understand the logic behind 22 grown persons running after a ball.
                        Also, my brother would receive strokes of the cane for leaving household chores to go play or watch football with his friends.
                        I preferred cartoons or the Philippine movies. They made more sense to me.                       
                        My brother and I would always fight over the remote control and try to ration our TV times.                       
                        Grudgingly and gradually, I began to pay attention to the people running around the pitch, especially the fine boys. ü•µ           
                        I would ask questions like ‚Äúwho is wearing red and who is wearing blue?‚Äù                       
                        I began to understand that there are different clubs under different leagues. For example, Chelsea under Premier League; Barcelona under La Liga.                       
                        There's also country football, like when Nigeria plays South Africa.                       
                        He also taught me the meaning of the 18 yard box.                  
                        With time, I understood certain rules binding the football game. I understood the meaning of offsides, red card offenses and yellow card offenses.                     
                        Then, we discussed corner kicks, free kicks and penalty kicks.                 
                        I began to fall in love with the game. Initially, I went with the winning team at that time Arsenal.                  
                        Then I transited to support the biggest club in the World. The Blues!! For life!!
                        My interest grew. I learnt more. Player names and their positions on the football pitch.               
                        I learnt about transfer windows and how they sold and bought players like crayfish in the market.        
                        Only that, crayfish wouldn't cost 80 million pounds.
                        
                        Football became my happy place. On some days, I would be so pissed at my club that I would lose my appetite.              
                        On some other days, I would be so happy and jiggly, when my club wins games.
                        I remember when we won the Champions League in 2021. I screamed my lungs out. I jubilated as though I had won a trip to Maldives.              
                        Some times too, I cry when a coach is laid off. I miss you Thomas Tuchel.
                        The best part is the adrenaline rush that comes with the games. My God!               
                        The arguments on twitter and viewing centers are always crazy.            
                        I love eeeeeet!       
                        The love. The unity. The passion. The joy. The fans. Damn!</p>
